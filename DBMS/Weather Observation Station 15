Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.





SOLUTION:
select round(LONG_W,4)              //Rounding the answer off the 4 decimal places
from STATION
where LAT_N = (                   //Sub query to get highest LAT_N < 137.2345
select max(LAT_N)
from STATION
where LAT_N < 137.2345
);
