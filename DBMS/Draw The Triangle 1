P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):

* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * *

Write a query to print the pattern P(20).



SOLUTION:

set @number = 21;
select repeat('* ', @number := @number - 1) from information_schema.tables;                      




//The function works like that: repeat(string, times)
//So, at the beginning we want to repeat the '*' symbol 20 times, but we also want to decrement its value by one in each iteration. That's why we start with 21.
//So in the first iteration we apply 21-1=20, and we repeat the '*' symbol 20 times.
//In the second we will apply 20-1=19, and we will repeat the '*' symbol 19 times.
//The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES view allows you to get information about all tables and views within a database. By default it will show you this information for every single table and view that is in the database.

//Look up information schema table
