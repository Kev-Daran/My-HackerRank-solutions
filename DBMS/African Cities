Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Africa'.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.




SOLUTION:

select CITY.NAME
from   CITY, COUNTRY
where  COUNTRY.CONTINENT = 'Africa'                     // Getting the code of the country which has continent as Africa
and    CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE;




ALTERNATE SOLUTION:

Select Name From City Where CountryCode In (
    Select Code From Country Where Continent = 'Africa'               //Using subqueries
);


ANOTHER ALTERNATE SOLUTION:

Select City.Name From City Inner Join Country 
On CountryCode = Code                                                       //Using join
Where Continent = 'Africa';
