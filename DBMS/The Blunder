Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual - miscalculated  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.





SOLUTION:

select ceil(avg(SALARY) - avg(REPLACE(Salary, '0','')))                   //To remove 0 from the Salary value we replace 0 with an empty string
from   EMPLOYEES;
