Consider P1(1,b) and P2(a,b) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.



SOLUTION:

SELECT ROUND((MAX(Lat_N) - MIN(Lat_N)) + (MAX(Long_W) - MIN(Long_W)), 4)       //Manhattan distance formula |X1 – X2| + |Y1 – Y2|
FROM   Station;
