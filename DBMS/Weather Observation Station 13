Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.









SOLUTION:
select round(sum(LAT_N),4) from STATION
where LAT_N > 38.7880 and
LAT_N < 137.2345;           //Select the sum of LAT_N where LAT_N satisfies the given condition
