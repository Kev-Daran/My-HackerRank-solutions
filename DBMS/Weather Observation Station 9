Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.





SOLUTION:

select DISTINCT CITY from STATION
where CITY NOT REGEXP "^[aeiou].*";             //Using Regexp, consider Non questions/regexp




ANOTHER SOLUTION:
SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[^aeiou]';
//Putting a ^ inside the closed bracket means something completely different than putting it outside the brackets. Putting it inside the brackets makes it match all characters //EXCEPT the ones inside the bracket. So instead of writing [bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz], we can write [^aeiou]
