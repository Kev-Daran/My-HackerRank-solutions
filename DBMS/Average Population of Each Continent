Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.



SOLUTION:

SELECT COUNTRY.CONTINENT, FLOOR(AVG(CITY.POPULATION))            // floor rounds down the average of the city population to the nearest integer
FROM CITY INNER JOIN COUNTRY                                      
ON CITY.COUNTRYCODE = COUNTRY.CODE                              //Joining the two tables based on countrycode to get the right country and grouping the countrues by continent
GROUP BY COUNTRY.CONTINENT;
