The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

A Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter is planted at the onset of spring. How tall will the tree be after n growth cycles?

SOLUTION:
def utopianTree(n):
    # Write your code here
    h = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if i%2 == 0:
            h *= 2
        else:
            h += 1
    return h
    
    
   ANOTHER SOLUTION:
def utopianTree(n):       //Recursive method
    if n < 3:
        return n + 1
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return (utopianTree(n - 2) * 2) + 1
    else:
        return (utopianTree(n - 2) + 1) * 2
