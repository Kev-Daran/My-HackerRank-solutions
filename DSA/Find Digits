Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

Sample Input

2
12
1012

Sample Output

2
3


SOLUTION:

def findDigits(n):
    # Write your code here
    temp = str(n)                                           //first we convert the number into a string, so 1012 becomes "1012"
    count = 0
    for x in temp:                                          //We iterate over elements of the string, so '1', '0', '1', '2'
        try:
            if n % int(x) == 0:                             //Avoiding divide by zero error
                count += 1                                  //Convert '1' into 1 by using int() funxtion and checking the condition
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            pass
    
    return count
