SOLUTION:
def gradingStudents(grades):
    # Write your code here
    for i in range(len(grades)):
        if grades[i] % 5 == 0:                    //As per conditions given in the question
            continue
        elif grades[i] < 38:                      //As per conditions given in the question
            continue
        elif ((((grades[i] // 5)+1)*5) - grades[i]) < 3:                  //if the difference between the next multiple of 5 and the marks is less than 3 then round up
            grades[i] = (((grades[i] // 5)+1)*5)
            
    return grades
