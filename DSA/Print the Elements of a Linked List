Complete the printLinkedList function in the editor below.

printLinkedList has the following parameter(s):

SinglyLinkedListNode head: a reference to the head of the list
Print

For each node, print its data value on a new line .



Sample Input

2
16
13
Sample Output

16
13


SOLUTION(Python):
def printLinkedList(head):
    temp = head
    if(head == None):             //Checking if there are elements in the given linked list
        return
    while(temp != None):          //Iterating to the end of the linked list
        print(temp.data)          //Printing the data in each node
        temp = temp.next          //Setting temp as the next element of the linked list


RECURSIVE SOLUTION:
def print_list(head):
    if head:                        //while there are values in head
        print(head.data)            //print the value of data in head
        print_list(head.next)       //Call the same function but with the next node as head
