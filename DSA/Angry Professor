A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, the professor decides to cancel class if fewer than some number of students are present when class starts. Arrival times go from on time () to arrived late ().

Given the arrival time of each student and a threshhold number of attendees, determine if the class is cancelled.


Sample Input

2
4 3
-1 -3 4 2
4 2
0 -1 2 1
Sample Output

YES
NO


SOLUTION:
def angryProfessor(k, a):
    # Write your code here
    a = [x for x in a if x <= 0]            //making a list of all the students that arrived on time
    
    if len(a) >= k:
        return "NO"
    else:
        return "YES"
