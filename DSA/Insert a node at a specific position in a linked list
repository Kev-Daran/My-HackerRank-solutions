Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to insert at a certain position, create a new node with the given integer as its  attribute, insert this node at the desired position and return the head node.

A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

SOLUTION:
def insertNodeAtPosition(llist, data, position):
    # Write your code here
    curpos = 1
    newnode = SinglyLinkedListNode(data)
    newnode.data = data
    temp = llist
    while temp != None:
        if curpos == position:
            newnode.next = temp.next
            temp.next = newnode
            break
        curpos += 1
        temp = temp.next
    return llist
