45°



SOLUTION:
import math
AB = int(input())
BC = int(input())
print(round(math.degrees(math.atan(AB/BC))),end="°")            //arctan(AB/BC) will give the answer in radians, which is then converted to degrees and then rounded up

//° is not being accepted however and while it will say the submission was successful in the submissions section it won't show when submitting in the editor
