Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of elements to delete to leave only elements of equal value.


Sample Input

STDIN       Function
-----       --------
5           arr[] size n = 5
3 3 2 1 3   arr = [3, 3, 2, 1, 3]
Sample Output

2   


SOLUTION:
def equalizeArray(arr):
    # Write your code here
    return len(arr)-max([arr.count(i) for i in arr])     //len(arr) - the frequency of the element that appears the most
