SOLUTION:
def reversePrint(llist):
    # Write your code here
    if llist.next != None:
        reversePrint(llist.next)        //Recursively reaching the end of the linked list
    print(llist.data)                   //Unpacking the linked list from the end (function having the tail will print the tail value and return to the function having the 
                                        //value just before the tail, which will further print it and so on
