Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it.

Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:

The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.
Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.

# MY SOLUTION:

def birthday(s, d, m):
    # Write your code here
    count = 0                            
    for i in range(len(s)-m+1):              //Avoiding overflow as we need m contiguous blocks
        num = 0
        for j in range(m):
            num += s[i+j]                   // Adding values of m contiguous blocks
        
        if num == d:
            count += 1                      //If they're equal to d then incrementing count which will be returned
    
    return count
    
    
    
# ANOTHER SOLUTION:
def getWays(squares, d, m): 
    count = 0    
    for i in range(0,len(squares)+1-m):
        if sum(squares[i:i+m]) == d:            
            count+=1
    return count
    
    
  // Same complexity but using the sum(l[x:y]) will reduce the lines of code
