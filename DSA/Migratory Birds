Given an array of bird sightings where every element represents a bird type id, determine the id of the most frequently sighted type. If more than 1 type has been spotted that maximum amount, return the smallest of their ids.

Sample Input 0

6
1 4 4 4 5 3
Sample Output 0

4



SOLUTION:

def migratoryBirds(arr):
    # Write your code here
    ans = 0
    count = 0
    for item in arr:
        if arr.count(item) > count:
            count = arr.count(item)                      //Counting the number of each elements in the list
            ans = item
    return ans
    
 // ABOVE CODE WILL NOT MEET THE TIME REQUIREMENTS
 
 
 ANOTHER SOLUTION:
 
 input()
count = [0]*6
for t in map(int,input().strip().split()):          //for t in all input
    count[t] += 1                                   //incrementing the count of type t, i.e, bird of type 1 incremeneted, then count[4] incremented 3 times etc.
print(count.index(max(count)))                  //print the index, i.e, the type of bird which has the highest value


// ABOVE CODE IS MORE EFFICIENT
