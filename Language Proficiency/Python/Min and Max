You are given a 2-D array with dimensions NXM.
Your task is to perform the min function over axis 1 and then find the max of that.


Sample Input

4 2
2 5
3 7
1 3
4 0
Sample Output

3


SOLUTION:

import numpy

n, m = map(int, input().split())
l = []

for i in range(n):
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))                   
    l.append(a)                                       //Creating a 2d list


print(max(numpy.min(l, axis = 1)))                   //Getting the min of the values in the acis 1 and then printing the max of them
