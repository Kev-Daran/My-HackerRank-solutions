A set is an unordered collection of elements without duplicate entries.
When printed, iterated or converted into a sequence, its elements will appear in an arbitrary order.
Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with distinct heights in her greenhouse.

Sample Input

STDIN                                       Function
-----                                       --------
10                                          arr[] size N = 10
161 182 161 154 176 170 167 171 170 174     arr = [161, 181, ..., 174]
Sample Output

169.375


SOLUTION:

def average(array):
    # your code goes here
    return sum(set(array))/len(set(array))               //Average of unique elements in the array
