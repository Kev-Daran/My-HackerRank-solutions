You are given a two lists A and B. Your task is to compute their cartesian product A X B.



Sample Input

 1 2
 3 4
Sample Output

 (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4)
 
 
 
 SOLUTION:
from itertools import product

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(*product(a, b))                      //* is used to unpack the list, i.e, [(1,2),(2,3)] will appear as (1,2) (2,3) => whitespace separated with no square brackets
