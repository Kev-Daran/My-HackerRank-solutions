There is a series, S, where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series, a, b, and c respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion.




Sample Input 0

5
1 2 3
Sample Output 0

11


SOLUTION:
int find_nth_term(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
  //Write your code here.
  if (n>3)
  {
      find_nth_term( n-1,  a,  b,  c) + find_nth_term( n-2,  a,  b,  c) + find_nth_term( n-3,  a,  b,  c); //Done according to the instructions given in the question
  }
  else if(n==1)
  {
      return a;
  }
  else if(n==2)
  {
      return b;
  }
  else
  {
      return c;
  }
  return 0;
}
