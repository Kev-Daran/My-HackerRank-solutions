Objective

This challenge will help you to learn how to take a character, a string and a sentence as input in C.

To take a single character  as input, you can use scanf("%c", &ch ); and printf("%c", ch) writes a character specified by the argument char to stdout







SOLUTION:
int main() 
{
    char ch, word[10], sentence[100];
    scanf("%c %s %[^\n]s", &ch, word, sentence);
    printf("%c\n%s\n%s",ch,word,sentence);

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */    
    return 0;
}


//%[^\n]s will take inputs until \n is encountered
