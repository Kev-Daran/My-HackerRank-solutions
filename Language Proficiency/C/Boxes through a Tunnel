You are transporting some boxes through a tunnel, where each box is a parallelepiped, and is characterized by its length, width and height.

The height of the tunnel 41 feet and the width can be assumed to be infinite. A box can be carried through the tunnel only if its height is strictly less than the tunnel's height. Find the volume of each box that can be successfully transported to the other end of the tunnel. Note: Boxes cannot be rotated.

1 2 40
10 5 41
7 2 42
Sample Output 0

SOLUTION:
//This is not a parellelpiped but just a cuboid
struct box
{
	/**
	* Define three fields of type int: length, width and height
	*/
    int length, width, height;
};

typedef struct box box;

int get_volume(box b) {
	/**
	* Return the volume of the box
	*/
    return b.length*b.height*b.width;             //Volume of a cuboid
}

int is_lower_than_max_height(box b) {
	/**
	* Return 1 if the box's height is lower than MAX_HEIGHT and 0 otherwise
	*/
    return b.height<41;                         //If the condition is true it returns 1 and if its false it returns 0
}
